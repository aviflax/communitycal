Our user has provided a plain-English description of an event, which might be recurring.

Here is the description:

> %s

Convert the description into iCalendar format.

Make each property value highly concise.

When constructing the VEVENT, only include a DESCRIPTION property if it would contain additional information that is not in the other properties.

When generating the iCalendar document, make sure not to include the parameters `DTSTART` nor `EXDATE` in the property `RRULE`.

Respond only with the iCalendar document. Do not wrap it in anything, especially not a Markdown code fence.
