# Mockups » To Do

* Remove “invitees” section from `new.html` in favor of the “share” step

* Consider changing “activate” to “publish”

* Consider changing “invitee” to “participant”

* Consider adding a “process steps” indicator to the top of the new-calendar process
  * I’m sure there’s an actual term for this but I don’t know what it is

* The current tagline is not great; try to think of a better one

* Maybe: as part of the account activation process, ask if we can send them a *single* email when
  the “pro” edition is ready
